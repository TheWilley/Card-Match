# Card Match

This is a React implementation of the memorization game "Card Match" where the player has to match cards. Each time a match is found, the player is granted ten points. Each time a match is not found, the player looses one point. Same color matches grants 15 points.

The game was made to sharpen my React knowledge and because it's fun. It was made in about 5 days or so (give or take).
